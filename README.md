Human and communication are inseparable. For this reason, it is very important to be able to express feelings towards the other side in people and their communication. Nowadays, with the digitalizing world, people perform most of their communication in a written form in computer environment. The inability of these text data to express feelings and thoughts is a big problem in terms of communication. In order to eliminate or minimize this problem, it is very important to analyze the sentiments contained in the text data. In this context, many input representation models (Word2Vec, Doc2Vec) and text classification models (Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, LSTM) were developed and evaluated in our study. As a result of the evaluations, the sentiment contained in the text data in the film reviews and the score corresponding to the text were estimated successfully with the most successful models. A report is presented to the user/institution along with the analysis of the user-based data generated as a result of the estimations.
